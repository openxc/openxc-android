/**
 * The VehicleManager is an in-process Android service and the primary entry
 * point into the OpenXC library.
 *
 * An OpenXC application should bind to this service and request vehicle
 * measurements through it either synchronously or asynchronously. The service
 * will shut down when no more clients are bound to it.
 *
 * Synchronous measurements are obtained by passing the type of the desired
 * measurement to the {@link #get(Class)} method.
 * Asynchronous measurements are obtained by defining a Measurement.Listener
 * object and passing it to the service via the addListener method.
 *
 *
 * There are three major components in the VehicleManager:
 * {@link com.openxc.sources.VehicleDataSource},
 * {@link com.openxc.sinks.VehicleDataSink} and
 * {@link com.openxc.interfaces.VehicleInterface}.
 *
 * The list of {@link com.openxc.interfaces.VehicleInterface} is perhaps the
 * most important. These instances represent actual physical connections to the
 * vehicle, and are bi-directional - they can both provide data to an
 * application and optionally send data back to the vehicle. In most cases,
 * these should not be instantiated by applications; the
 * {@link #addVehicleInterface(Class, String)} and
 * {@link #removeVehicleInterface(Class)} methods
 * take enough metadata from the remote {@link com.openxc.remote.VehicleService}
 * to instantiate the interface in a remove process. That way a single USB or
 * Bluetooth connection can be shared among many applications. If an application
 * really needs to use a custom VehicleInterface implementation and does not
 * mind if access to its write interface will be accessible only in the local
 * app process, the {@link #addLocalVehicleInterface(VehicleInterface)} and
 * {@link #removeLocalVehicleInterface(VehicleInterface)} can let you do that.
 *
 * The list of active data sources (e.g.
 * {@link com.openxc.sources.trace.TraceVehicleDataSource}) can be controlled
 * with the {@link #addSource(VehicleDataSource)} and
 * {@link #removeSource(VehicleDataSource)} methods. Each active
 * {@link com.openxc.interfaces.VehicleInterface} is also an active data source,
 * so there is no need to add them twice. Even though data sources are
 * instantiated by the application (and thus can be entirely customized), their
 * data is still shared among all OpenXC applications using the same remove
 * process {@link com.openxc.remote.VehicleService}
 *
 * The list of active data sinks (e.g.
 * {@link com.openxc.sinks.FileRecorderSink}) can be controlled with the
 * {@link #addSink(VehicleDataSink)} and {@link #removeSink(VehicleDataSink)}
 * methods.
 *
 * When a message is received from a
 * {@link com.openxc.sources.VehicleDataSource}, it is passed to all active
 * {@link com.openxc.sinks.VehicleDataSink}s. There will always be at
 * least one sink that stores the latest messages and handles passing on data to
 * users of this service.
