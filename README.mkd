This library is a part of the [OpenXC][] project.

This Android library contains the tools required to read vehicle data from the
vehicle's CAN bus through the OpenXC vehicle interface in any Android
application.

Visit the [OpenXC][] project page for
[installation
instructions](http://openxcplatform.com/getting-started/library-installation.html),
[usage details](http://openxcplatform.com/android/api-guide.html) and the
[source code documentation](http://android.openxcplatform.com).

## Building from Eclipse

After cloning the `openxc-android` repository to your local disk, open Eclipse
and go to `File -> New -> Other -> Android -> Android Project from Existing
Source`. Browse to the `openxc-android` folder and it should detect the 4
Android projects within the repository. At the minimum, add the `openxc` project
(the Android library itself) and `OpenXcEnablerActivity` (the Enabler app,
required to run OpenXC applications).

## Tests

To run the unit tests suite:

    $ mvn test -pl openxc

To generate a code coverage report for the test suite:

    $ mvn cobertura:cobertura -pl openxc

To run the instrumentation tests (must have an attached Android device or
emulator):

    $ mvn install -pl openxc -am
    $ mvn install -pl openxc-it

## Building from Command Line

The build requires [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/download.html)
v3.0.3+ and the [Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
to be installed in your development environment. In addition you'll need to set
the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable to the location of your SDK:

    export ANDROID_HOME=/opt/tools/android-sdk

You also need the Android support library, but unfortunately Google doesn't
deploy the latest versions of this to the the Central Maven repository. Instead,
you must open the Android SDK manager and install the "Android Support
Repository" package (under "Extras"). Next, open a terminal and navigate to your
SDK's top-level directory (e.g. `/home/user/android-sdk`.

You must manually copy the Maven artifacts from this folder to your local
repository:

    $ cp -R $ANDROID_HOME/extras/android/m2repository/com ~/.m2/repository

After satisfying those requirements, the build is pretty simple:

To compile the OpenXC library as an APKLIB and install it to your local
Maven repository:

    $ mvn install -pl openxc -am

To compile and build and APK for the Enabler app (that uses the OpenXC
library):

    $ mvn package -pl enabler

Finally, to deploy the packaged APK to an attached Android device and run it:

    $ mvn android:deploy android:run -pl enabler

* Run `mvn clean install -pl openxc,openxc-it -am` from the root directory to build and run
  the library and test suite. This requires that an Android device is attached or an
  emulator is running.

If you want the tests to wait for a debugger to attach, change the `testDebug`
setting in `openxc-android/pom.xml` to `true`.

## Automatic Crash Reporting

The Enabler includes optional support for automatic crash reporting via Bugsnag.
If you wish to enable this, create a resources file in `enabler/res/values` with
your Bugsnag token, e.g.:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
    <string name="bugsnag_token">0123456789</string>
</resources>

If no token is found, Bugsnag will not be included in the build.

The APK files upload to the GitHub releases page are built with Bugsnag
included, reporting to an accout that the OpenXC maintainers can review to
improve the project. If you wish to not have any crash reports collected from
your device, please build the Enabler from the source code.
